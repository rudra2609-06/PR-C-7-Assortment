# README for C Array Programs

This repository contains several C programs that demonstrate basic operations on arrays, including one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays. Each program prompts the user for input and performs specific tasks, such as finding negative numbers, identifying the largest number, transposing a matrix, and calculating the sum of elements in a specified row or column.

## Programs Overview

1. **Finding Negative Numbers in an Array**
   - Prompts the user to enter the size of an array and its elements.
   - Displays all negative numbers in the array or prints "Zero" if there are none.

2. **Finding the Largest Number in a 2D Array**
   - Prompts the user to enter the dimensions of a 2D array and its elements.
   - Finds and displays the largest number in the array.

3. **Transposing a Square Matrix**
   - Prompts the user to enter the size of a square matrix and its elements.
   - Displays the transposed matrix.

4. **Calculating Sum of Elements in a Row and Column**
   - Prompts the user to enter the dimensions of a 2D array and its elements.
   - Allows the user to specify a row and a column index, then displays the elements and their sums.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run the programs, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the C files.
4. Compile the desired program using the following command:
   ```bash
   gcc -o program_name program_name.c
   ```
5. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

## Requirements

- C compiler (GCC or similar)
- Basic understanding of C programming and arrays
